# Portfolio-Sofia-Romero

My front-end developer professional portfolio created with HTML, CSS y JavaScript.

- HTML ---> First of all I created the whole structure of the page with HTML including the following elements:
    * header with a navbar including logo and hamburger button
    * Introduction section with h1 title, paragraph and image
    * My Services section with h2 title and below created the div elements for the different columns of each section
    * About me section with h2 title, paragraph text and img
    * My Work section with h2 tag, paragrapgh text and a div to wrap each of the anchor tags with images
    * Footer section with social media links and email anchor link

- CSS ---> Gave styles to all the classes I created in my html tags and also used global variables to be able to work faster

- JAVASCRIPT ---> When I finished with my CSS styling I added dynamism to some elements of the page with JS
